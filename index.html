    <h2>Redesigned Flier</h2>
    <p>
      To redesign the flier for the pumpkin patch, I used the CARP principles to show how different styles of design can change the way it affects the reader. First of all, I began with contrast: I used bold, bright text against a dark background and made the title stand out with a big, all-caps font so it grabs attention right away. I also used Halloween-like colours to match the vibe of a pumpkin patch. One quote from The Non-Designer’s Design Book stood out to me: “If two items are not exactly the same, then make them different. Really different.” After reading this I decided that not only did I want the colours of the font to contrast but I also wanted all the fonts to be different so that they almost clash with each other. My idea behind this was that I wanted each individual piece of text to stand out. Next, I moved onto repetition. I wanted everything to feel very cohesive and almost uniform. I looked into how certain brands combine their product into their logo such as Burger King and KFC – to me, it almost feels like an added layer of repetition. After creating each individual pumpkin I reused the same font styles and colours on each one to ensure everything remained consistent. This helps the whole design feel like it belongs together instead of a mix of random elements. Then I moved onto alignment. For this principle I wanted everything to look neat and organised. I lined up everything cleanly to the left, which helped my text to keep a consistent flow and made it easy to read. However, on reflection, I believe this flier could have been a bit more creative as I feel it lacks the ability to draw the reader in. Finally, I began designing my proximity flier. I grouped related information like opening hours, location, and contact details closely together so it was easy to find. I changed the important text into a bold font. I found this one particularly challenging as although I grouped my text together, I still find it somewhat overwhelming to read.

  <h2>Typographic Systems</h2>
  <p>
    For this task, I explored the eight different typographic systems, axial, radial, dilatational, random, grid, modular, transitional, and bilateral. During my time working on this project, I found it very interesting how the same text, colours and font can be used and yet each system created a different vibe. I found the dilatational layout particularly fun to create as it allows the text to flow in a certain way that draws your eyes in. The transitional system was the most challenging as it pushed me to break rules while still keeping things readable. In contrast, grid and modular systems were quite satisfying to make as they are very clean and organised. If I were to do this again, I’d try to make my transitional system more unique as although I find it to be quite a challenging system, I think it could also be the most creative one.
