  <h2>Redesigned Flier</h2>
  <p>
    To redesign the flier for the pumpkin patch, I used the <strong>CARP principles</strong> to show how different styles of design can change the way it affects the reader.
  </p>
  <p>
    First of all, I began with <strong>Contrast</strong>: I used bold, bright text against a dark background and made the title stand out with a big, all-caps font so it grabs attention right away. I also used Halloween-like colours to match the vibe of a pumpkin patch. One particular quote from <em>The Non-Designer’s Design Book</em> that stood out to me was: <br>
    <em>“If two items are not exactly the same, then make them different. Really different.”</em> <br>
    (Robin Williams, 2015, p. 65).
  </p>
  <p>
    After reading this, I decided that not only did I want the colours of the font to contrast but I also wanted all the fonts to be different so that they almost clash with each other. My idea behind this was that I wanted each individual piece of text to stand out.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, I moved onto <strong>Repetition</strong>. I wanted everything to feel very cohesive and almost uniform. I looked into how certain brands combine their product into their logo such as ‘Burger King’ and ‘KFC’. To me, it almost feels like an added layer of repetition. After creating each individual pumpkin I reused the same font styles and colours on each one to ensure everything remained consistent.
  </p>
  <p>
    This helps the whole design feel like it belongs together instead of a mix of random elements
    (<a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/repetition" target="_blank">Interaction Design Foundation, 2023</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, I moved onto <strong>Alignment</strong>. For this principle I wanted everything to look neat and organised. I lined up everything cleanly to the left, which helped my text to keep a consistent flow and made it easy to read. However, on reflection, I believe that this flier could have been a bit more creative as I feel it lacks the ability to draw the reader in.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, I began designing my <strong>Proximity</strong> flier. I grouped related information like opening hours, location, and contact details closely together so it was easy to find. I changed the important text into a bold font. I found this one particularly challenging as although I grouped my text together, I still find it somewhat overwhelming to read.

  <h2>Task 2: Typographic Systems</h2>
  <p>
    For this task, I explored the eight different typographic systems: <strong>axial, radial, dilatational, random, grid, modular, transitional,</strong> and <strong>bilateral</strong>.
    Each one challenged me to think outside the box about how text can be arranged to communicate different vibes.
  </p>
  <p>
    I found the <strong>dilatational</strong> layout particularly fun to create, as it allows the text to flow in a certain way that naturally draws your eyes in.
    The <strong>random</strong> system was the most challenging — it pushed me to break typical layout rules while still trying to keep everything readable.
  </p>
  <p>
    In contrast, <strong>grid</strong> and <strong>modular</strong> systems were really satisfying to build because of how clean and structured they are.
    They helped reinforce balance and consistency in layout.
  </p>
  <p>
    If I were to do this again, I’d push the <strong>contrast</strong> and <strong>spacing</strong> even further and explore more playful or expressive font choices
    to make each system’s visual personality stand out more clearly.
